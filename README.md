### Submission Contents

This submission contains the following components:

1. **Project Report**:
   - Overview of the problem
   - State of the art
   - Background information
   - The newest implementation done by team Accel

2. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Python implementation of all the analyzed Machine Learning algorithms:
     - Neural Network
     - Naive Bayes
     - Decision Tree
     - k-Nearest Neighbor
     - Random Forest

### How to Run

1. Load the notebook into Jupyter.
2. Follow the link to download the CSV file from [Wireless Indoor Localization Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1op9VmjKCFJJKdq3LBZhQJV8gqCE7GzBL/view).
3. Place the downloaded file into the environment where the notebook is running.
4. Run all the cells in the notebook.

**Note**: Running the full notebook might yield errors if some cells are executed out of order. The notebook is meant to be compiled in sequence.
